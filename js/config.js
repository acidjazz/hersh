Nancy and Kate treated us with respect and compassion throughout our 5-year lawsuit. They were attentive to our questions, always effectively and forcefully protected us from the aggressive behavior and strategies of defense attorneys, and encouraged us when the going was tough. We cannot imagine going through this long, difficult legal process with anybody other than Nancy and Kate. Not only are they wonderful people, they are also exceptionally talented attorneys. <br /><br />Our case was very complicated and involved medical malpractice, product liability, and fraud. Nancy and Kate’s work on our behalf was highly professional, brilliant, tenacious and courageous. Whether the setting was trial court, depositions, mediation, or the Court of Appeals, their performance was stellar. When special expertise was required, they brought the best possible resources to the case. Through their persistent efforts the case was successfully resolved. While the settlement will not replace what the original incident took from us, it will provide for future care and security.
