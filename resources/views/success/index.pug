      p Our creativity and willingness to undertake cases of first impression and to fight and win for our clients started in the late 70’s when we were the first firm to accept and file drug product cases for children of women who had been give a miscarriage preventative (DES) which caused injury to the fetus which manifested in their adolescence.  This pioneering spirit continued when we tried and won the first breast implant case that established that the manufacturer had lied about leakage of silicone into surrounding tissue and the link between the leaking silicone and auto immune disease in patients.  Then we resolved the first Fen-Phen diet drug case by searching for and finding the causal link between the drug and the horrible, life threatening lung condition Primary Pulmonary Hypertesion (PPH) aka Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH).  As you can see by the examples listed here, this spirit of innovative litigation continues today.

      p We are passionate about achieving the best results for our clients and here is the proof. . . 
      p We just successfully settled a case for nine families with 13 children who lived in three different countries whose children were born as a result of sperm purchased from a sperm “donor” whose identity was revealed and turned out to be schizophrenic. Schizophrenia can be passed on to children and they needed medical monitoring.  No such case had ever been filed and successfully litigated.  We fought and won efforts to dismiss the case, efforts to send all of the cases to the home state of the sperm bank, Georgia, hoping to dismiss the cases there.  No other firm even considered being the first to file this case and we used legal theories such as deceptive business practices that were unique and creative.  The parties agreed to keep the settlement amount confidential.  The defendant initiated changes in its processing of sperm donors to prevent this recurring as a result of our cases.
      p We successfully turned what other lawyers thought was a difficult medical malpractice case with a cap on damages into a case against the manufacturer of the drug that caused the horrific injuries and, more importantly, the creator and seller of the drug literature the pharmacy provided which did not warn about a deadly drug-related condition.  After each defendant tried unsuccessfully to get the case dismissed, we fought an appeal and won, resulting in a multi-million dollar settlement  The defendants changed their drug literature and their processes as a result of our case.
      p We took and won a case before the Vaccine Court in which a young boy had an unusual reaction to Gardasil, the shot given to prevent HPV.  We persevered in the Vaccine Court using our creativity and medical expertise. This victory put the injury to our client, XXX, on the list of consequences associated with this vaccine.
      p We have successfully fought on behalf of families who lost children as a result of drug overdoses which occurred at the Universities they were attending.  We argued successfully that the dorms and students were inadequately informed and trained with respect to the consequences and signs of drug overdose and appropriate response to overdose.  Many Universities now have policies assuring students that they will not be punished if they call for medical help in situations involving drugs and we are pushing more Universities to adopt similar policies.
      p We represent a family whose wife/mother was poisoned by tea “prescribed” and sold by an herbal tea store.  Her death was horrendous and her family is devastated.  We did not just file a wrongful death case but we saw that the facts supported an additional and more compelling claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress on behalf of the husband of the woman who was poisoned and died. We discovered that the tea was contaminated by a poisonous herb from China and have now located the distributor and manufacturer. Stay tuned for the result.
      p We tried a case to a jury in Federal Court for Terminix employees who were misclassified as exempt in order to pay them less than they were entitled under the wage and hour laws.  Terminix is a huge corporation that brought lawyers in from Chicago to try the San Francisco case.  Undeterred, we won for these hard working people and they received past wages and penalties.

      p Recovered millions for a client against the California Department of Transportation for the dangerous condition of Interstate 80 in Fairfield. Hersh & Hersh claimed that Caltrans failed to provide a safe and effective median barrier along the interstate to prevent cross - over accidents like this from occurring.
      .title Professional Liability & Malpractice (Medical, Legal & Other)
      p Filed landmark cases against Xytex Corporation, a sperm bank, for fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation of “donor” and failure to do background checks. (Article 1 Article 2)
      .title Landmark Embryo Mix-up Case
      p Settled a case against Fertility Medical Associates of the Bay Area, a fertility clinic that implanted an embryo belonging to another couple during Jane Doe's in vitro fertilization procedure. The suit alleged that the clinic scientist and the doctor knew before Jane Doe left their offices on the day of the implantation that they had implanted the wrong embryo in her. But the clinic did not inform Ms. Doe and the couple of the mix-up until a year and a half later, and then only after the California Medical Board began investigating the switch
      .title Birth Injury Case
      p Successfully represented many families whose babies have suffered severe and permanent brain injuries and other physical injuries as a result of negligent management of labor, delivery and resuscitation. Hersh & Hersh successfully settled a case for over $6 million dollars against a San Francisco Hospital because its labor and delivery nurse failed to properly manage a laboring mother causing her baby severe brain injury. Hersh & Hersh teamed with experts in the field of obstetrics, radiology and neurology to bring this case to a successful resolution and provide the family with the financial security needed to ensure excellent future care and treatment for their child.
