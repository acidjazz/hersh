      .title Dangerous Property Conditions
      .copy
        p Property can be dangerous for a number of reasons, including the failure by an owner to warn of a dangerous condition, rules and regulations that are unsafe, a defective product or item, like a ladder, on the property, failure by the owner to have security on site, or dangerous conditions on a roadway, to name a few.
        p We have successfully represented people who have sustained injuries because a property they entered was unsafe, including worksites, construction sites or roadways. Also, any “on the job injury” may be caused by a person or company, not just your employer. This could mean you get addition compensation, not just workers' compensation.
        p We have worked on cases involving a man at work who fell from a defective ladder attached to a building, a brain injury from drug overdose in a university residence because of policies and procedures in the residence, death from assault in a nightclub without sufficient security, and injuries from a defective guardrail on a roadway piercing a vehicle and the people in it.
