        p There are specific laws in place to protect employees.
        p Both large and small employers often take advantage of their workers by violating federal, state, and local laws. Employees may not realize that they are entitled to minimum wage, overtime, meal and rest breaks, prompt payment of wages, detailed wage statements, and reimbursement. Employees also may be unaware that they are misclassified as “independent contractors” or as employees “exempt” from wage and hour protections.
        p We have successfully represented employees against their employers in cases involving the failure to pay certain wages to employees and misclassification of workers, thereby denying employees overtime, as well as cases involving harassment and discrimination, including sexual harassment, on the job. 
        p We won a landmark jury verdict in Federal Court against an employer for misclassifying employees and denying them wages, meal and rest breaks. 
        p If you or your co-workers believe your employer has taken advantage of you, you can speak confidentially with one of our attorneys. We can advise you on your rights and evaluate whether your employer has failed to comply with the rules and regulations that protect you.
