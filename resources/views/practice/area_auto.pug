        p We have worked on cases involving pedestrians struck by taxis, commuting bicyclists hit by cars, catastrophic injuries sustained by passengers of a van due to dangerous highway/roadway conditions, injuries to an elderly resident due to a Muni driver’s negligence in operating a lift. 
        p We are expert at obtaining full compensation for injured people including medical expenses, lost past and future wages, future medical care costs, attendant care, and pain, suffering and emotional distress.
        p We have years of experience representing people who have been injured in motor vehicle accidents, or accidents involving trucks, bicycles or other transport. We have also successfully represented people who have been injured in accidents during sporting or recreational activities, like wrestling, swimming or zip-lining.
