        p A Motor vehicle, bicycle, pedestrian or other accident can happen at anytime and your life can be changed in an instant. When that happens you need a passionate and compassionate attorney who can fight for you. The insurance company will hire the best. So should you! 
        p We are expert at obtaining full compensation for injured people including medical expenses, lost past and future wages, future medical care costs, attendant care, and pain, suffering and emotional distress.
        p We have years of experience representing people who have been injured in motor vehicle accidents, or accidents involving trucks, bicycles or other transport. We have also successfully represented people who have been injured in accidents during sporting or recreational activities, like wrestling, swimming or zip-lining.
        p We have worked on cases where pedestrians were struck by San Francisco Taxis, commuting bicyclists hit by a car, a van that struck a defective guardrail which caused catastrophic injuries to the van’s passengers, an elderly San Francisco resident who fell from a Muni bus lift due to the driver’s negligence.
