Serious injury caused by the negligence of another person or a defective product, can leave a victim in pain. It can also lead to a sense of vulnerability and fear. Lawyers have the opportunity to represent our clients to make sure they are compensated for losses caused by others. As lawyers, we cannot change the fact that our clients have suffered injury. But we can help to provide them with the financial and other assistance to which they are entitled under the law. We are able to seek both economic and non-economic damages to help injured victims deal with their lives after a tragic accident or injury.

  title: "Traumatic Brain Injury: How does it happen? How do you know if it has happened to you?"
  description: Often called concussion, post concussion syndrome or mild traumatic brain injury, these injuries can happen to anyone involved in a motor vehicle collision, particularly if you are struck from the rear. If your head and neck flex and extend in a rear-end collision, your brain moves in your skull and hits the front and the back of the skull. This motion and contact can cause injury to the brain which is not perceptible on MRI, but exists and has an impact on your life nevertheless.
