  - As California trial lawyers, we help our clients through very difficult times in their lives. One of the best ways to do that is to make sure that the public in general knows what to do before and after something happens that could alter their lives. 
  - For example, many people do not realize that if they are injured in a motor vehicle accident there is a way to make sure those injuries are covered. This is through what is known as <a href="http://www.insurance.ca.gov/0100-consumers/0060-information-guides/0010-automobile/Auto-insurance-101.cfm">Uninsured or Underinsured Motorist Coverage</a>. If you click on the link above, you will be taken to the California Department of Insurance website and you will find answers to basic questions about auto insurance, including uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. 
  - When you are involved in an accident, the driver responsible for resulting injuries may only have the minimum amount of insurance coverage required under the law and this may not be enough to cover injuries and damages. You need to make sure you have enough uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage through your own vehicle policy to cover your needs. Getting the highest amount of uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage is fast, inexpensive, easy and worthwhile. 
  - To secure this type of coverage, contact your automobile insurance carrier and get the maximum amount available. Make sure that you&#8217;re insured because others may not be. We know this is important as we have represented a number of individuals in motor vehicle accidents and have recovered damages for their injuries, including using uninsured or underinsured motorist policies. 
  - Another cautionary note for our readers is knowing when your case begins. Did you know if you are injured in a motor vehicle accident or otherwise, your case starts when the other person&#8217;s or company&#8217;s insurance representative contacts you for a statement or for medical information?  We recommend that you do not give a statement and do not &#8220;give away&#8221; your medical information or current medical status.  
  - Instead, retain a lawyer and have that lawyer advise you immediately.  It might seem like the insurance representative is trying to help you resolve your case quickly and easily. It might see manageable, but it can quickly get complicated and you may not realize that the carrier is getting information from you that could be used to actually hurt you, not help you.
  - Sometimes cases can be resolved without a lawyer. However, other times, before you know it, you will want help and you may have done more harm than good. How will you know if the offer you get is fair? How will you know when to settle? Avoid getting in too deep and then realizing you need a lawyer to help you. An experienced legal counsel will let you know if you need a lawyer and can offer the help you need.
  - If you or a loved one has been injured in an automobile accident, please<a href="http://www.hershlaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1417897.html"> contact us </a>for a free evaluation of your legal and medical status.
