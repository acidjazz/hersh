You helped in ways that are not measurable.","Without your incredible kindness and caring, I would not be \"sane\" right now.  We will always be grateful for having found you.  We would send anyone with a legal issue to you, the support and expertise you provide is incomparable."],["Our family engaged Nancy Hersh to represent us after we experienced an unfortunate incident.  She is an incredibly genuine and gifted attorney. Hersh and Hersh was understanding, helpful and relentless in their work on our case. We could not have been happier with their representation.","We wanted to take a moment to thank you for helping us with our case.   Because of your hard work, experience, and reputation in this particular field our case was successful.  We really want you to know it was a pleasure to work with you and your staff.   Again, thank you for taking our case and helping our family come to some sort of closure in this matter."],["I would like to thank you for all you did to compensate me for the negative outcome of my hip replacement due to the defective implant which Sulzer had put out. At first I was reluctant to sign on but I am glad I contacted you and I am thankful you represented me. My hip will never be the same and will always be of great concern to me but I feel that someone, like you, was willing and able to represent me and give me some monetary comfort. Thank you for your hard work. Please continue to help those who feel helpless and vulnerable."],["Thank you for never giving up on my case.

YOU'RE THE GREATEST!"],["My husband and I can't begin to tell you how much your representation has meant to us. Not only are you an expert in your field, but you gave me tremendous emotional support and became our friend as well. Thank you for all you and your firm have done for us."],["How can I ever thank you for the way you handled my case. You are a wonderful lady, that is understanding and caring. You stood by me during the whole legal process encouraging me to \"hang in there.\" You did everything in your power to win this case for me. And you did! Thanks to your knowledge and your firm's research on PPH, you won this case for me. You are great and helped me tremendously."]]};
