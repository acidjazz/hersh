    - Words cannot express how grateful we are for the outstanding representation provided for us by Hersh and Hersh. Nancy and Kate treated us with respect and compassion throughout our 5-year lawsuit. They were attentive to our questions, always effectively and forcefully protected us from the aggressive behavior and strategies of defense attorneys, and encouraged us when the going was tough. We cannot imagine going through this long, difficult legal process with anybody other than Nancy and Kate. Not only are they wonderful people, they are also exceptionally talented attorneys. <br /><br />Our case was very complicated and involved medical malpractice, product liability, and fraud. Nancy and Kateâ€™s work on our behalf was highly professional, brilliant, tenacious and courageous. Whether the setting was trial court, depositions, mediation, or the Court of Appeals, their performance was stellar. When special expertise was required, they brought the best possible resources to the case. Through their persistent efforts the case was successfully resolved. While the settlement will not replace what the original incident took from us, it will provide for future care and security. We will be forever thankful for their help.<br /><br />-DH

    - Dear Nancy, Thank you from the bottom of my heart for the support you have given to me and my husband since his life-changing injury. What a lifeline to find you during the worst crisis of our lives and then to have you so compassionately apply your legal expertise in our case. Until we contacted you, we felt alone and lost.  You helped in ways that are not measurable.  
    - Without your incredible kindness and caring, I would not be "sane" right now.  We will always be grateful for having found you.  We would send anyone with a legal issue to you, the support and expertise you provide is incomparable.

    - I would like to thank you for all you did to compensate me for the negative outcome of my hip replacement due to the defective implant which Sulzer had put out. At first I was reluctant to sign on but I am glad I contacted you and I am thankful you represented me. My hip will never be the same and will always be of great concern to me but I feel that someone, like you, was willing and able to represent me and give me some monetary comfort. Thank you for your hard work. Please continue to help those who feel helpless and vulnerable.

    - How can I ever thank you for the way you handled my case. You are a wonderful lady, that is understanding and caring. You stood by me during the whole legal process encouraging me to "hang in there." You did everything in your power to win this case for me. And you did! Thanks to your knowledge and your firm's research on PPH, you won this case for me. You are great and helped me tremendously.
