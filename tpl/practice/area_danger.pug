      .copy

        p As consumers, we are exposed to various products daily and even when used correctly the products can be very dangerous and cause severe harm. Many of the products you use are unsafe due to manufacturing defects, failure to warn of dangerous propensities of which a manufacturer is aware, or other reasons. 
        p It's simple. Manufacturers must not sell products that endanger the public. If they do, they, along with the distributors, vendors, retailers, or others, can be held liable for the damages they cause. 
        p We have successfully represented thousands of people who have been victims of the failures by manufacturers to ensure the safety of their products. These manufacturers include drug manufacturers, medical device manufacturers, or manufacturers of other consumer products, like a baby toys or cribs, to name a few. Dangerous products have caused death, devastating injuries and permanent harm and have ruined people’s lives.
        p We have the knowledge, skills, resources and experience to investigate and pursue products cases against large corporations.
