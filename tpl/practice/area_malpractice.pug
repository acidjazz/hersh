        p Malpractice can occur in many contexts, including, for example, in an Emergency Department when a provider fails to diagnose or treat a stroke leading to permanent and disabling injuries, or during pregnancy, labor or delivery when a complication goes undiagnosed, unnoticed and untreated and a baby is born injured. 

        p For instance, a baby may be deprived of sufficient oxygen if a laboring mother's contractions are too frequent or intense and the doctors or nurses do nothing to correct the situation. This deprivation of oxygen during labor may result in permanent brain injury to the newborn. If your baby has problems such as developmental delay, it may be the result of a mismanaged labor and delivery.

        p We have obtained results that permit people to get long-term care and assistance for their injuries. We have had million dollar verdicts in many medical malpractice cases and have achieved great settlements in many others. 

        p We also have specific expertise in representing victims of fertility clinic and sperm bank negligence or fraud, including destruction of embryos, failure to screen donors, or failures to conduct genetic testing. 

        p We have successfully prosecuted cases against attorney’s for malpractice.
