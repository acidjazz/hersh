        <p>We have years of experience representing people who have been injured in motor vehicle accidents, or accidents involving trucks, bicycles or other transport. We have also successfully represented people who have been injured in accidents during regular sporting or recreational activities, like wrestling, swimming or zip-lining. </p>
        <p>We are working on cases involving a pedestrian struck down by a San Francisco Taxi, a commuting bicyclist hit by a car, a van that struck a defective guardrail which caused catastrophic injuries to the van’s passengers, an elderly San Francisco resident who fell from a Muni bus lift due to the driver’s negligence. </p>
