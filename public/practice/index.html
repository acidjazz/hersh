                  <p>Property can be dangerous for a number of reasons, including the failure by an owner to warn of a dangerous condition, rules and regulations that are unsafe, a defective product or item, like a ladder, on the property, failure by the owner to have security on site, or dangerous conditions on a roadway, to name a few.</p>
                  <p>We have successfully represented people who have sustained injuries because a property they entered was unsafe, including worksites, construction sites or roadways. Also, any “on the job injury” may be caused by a person or company, not just your employer. This could mean you get addition compensation, not just workers' compensation.</p>
                  <p>We have worked on cases involving a man at work who fell from a defective ladder attached to a building, a brain injury from drug overdose in a university residence because of policies and procedures in the residence, death from assault in a nightclub without sufficient security, and injuries from a defective guardrail on a roadway piercing a vehicle and the people in it.</p>

                  <p>Malpractice can occur in many contexts, including, for example, in an Emergency Department when a provider fails to diagnose or treat a stroke leading to permanent and disabling injuries, or during pregnancy, labor or delivery when a complication goes undiagnosed, unnoticed and untreated and a baby is born injured.</p>
                  <p>For instance, a baby may be deprived of sufficient oxygen if a laboring mother's contractions are too frequent or intense and the doctors or nurses do nothing to correct the situation. This deprivation of oxygen during labor may result in permanent brain injury to the newborn. If your baby has problems such as cerebral palsy, developmental delays, or other injuries, it may be the result of a mismanaged labor and delivery.</p>
                  <p>We have obtained results that permit people to get long-term care and assistance for their injuries. We have had multi-million dollar verdicts and settlements in many malpractice cases.</p>
                  <p>We have special expertise in representing victims of fertility clinic and sperm bank negligence or fraud, including destruction of embryos, failure to screen donors, or failure to conduct genetic testing.</p>
                  <p class="indented">We have also successfully prosecuted cases against other professionals including attorneys for professional negligence.</p>

                  <p>There are specific laws in place to protect employees.</p>
                  <p>Both large and small employers often take advantage of their workers by violating federal, state, and local laws. Employees may not realize that they are entitled to minimum wage, overtime, meal and rest breaks, prompt payment of wages, detailed wage statements, and reimbursement. Employees also may be unaware that they are misclassified as “independent contractors” or as employees “exempt” from wage and hour protections.</p>
                  <p>We have successfully represented employees against their employers in cases involving the failure to pay certain wages to employees and misclassification of workers, thereby denying employees overtime, as well as cases involving harassment and discrimination, including sexual harassment, on the job. </p>
                  <p>We won a landmark jury verdict in Federal Court against an employer for misclassifying employees and denying them wages, meal and rest breaks. </p>
                  <p>If you or your co-workers believe your employer has taken advantage of you, you can speak confidentially with one of our attorneys. We can advise you on your rights and evaluate whether your employer has failed to comply with the rules and regulations that protect you.</p>

                  <p>As consumers, we are exposed to various products daily and even when used correctly the products can be very dangerous and cause severe harm. Many of the products you use are unsafe due to manufacturing defects, failure to warn of dangerous propensities of which a manufacturer is aware, or improper deisgn.</p>
                  <p>It's simple. Manufacturers must not sell products that endanger the public. If they do, they, along with the distributors, vendors, retailers, or others, can be held responsible for the injuries they cause.</p>
                  <p>We have successfully represented thousands of people who have been victims of the failure by manufacturers to ensure the safety of their products. These manufacturers include drug manufacturers, medical device manufacturers, consumer product manufacturers, like baby toys or cribs, to name a few. Dangerous products have caused death, devastating injuries and permanent harm and have ruined people’s lives.</p>

                  <p>We successfully litigated and settled a case involving families whose children were born as a result of sperm purchased from a sperm bank that inadequately screened and assessed donors, and the families discovered that the donor used was schizophrenic, a hereditary condition. We achieved a great resolution and got the Sperm Bank to change its practices. </p>
                  <p>We achieved a great result for families who lost young college children as a result of drug overdoses at their schools. We successfully resolved these cases by showing that the students and housing organizations were inadequately or improperly trained, informed and instructed about how to respond to overdose. Many of the universities now have different policies.  </p>
