Together they built a firm based on essential values that continue to this day. Nancy's accomplishments are recognized by both her clients and her peers. She received the San Francisco Trial Lawyers Association Lifetime Achievement Award in April 2010, an honor that had never before been awarded to a woman trial lawyer. This award reflects Nancy's career and accomplishments in helping those injured and those who otherwise would have no voice.</p><p>Throughout her career Nancy has been a passionate advocate, using the law to address women's healthcare issues and other areas of social justice. As one of the first woman personal injury lawyers she combines the tenaciousness, determination, and empathy for her clients. These attributes are essential as she has tackled a series of groundbreaking cases including DES Litigation, the first breast implant case to establish the connection between silicone and physical injuries, and the first Diet Drug (Fen-Phen) case filed and settled.</p><p class="b">Personal Statement</p><p>A native San Franciscan, I am dedicated to using the law to achieve justice.</p><p>I was born in San Francisco and was raised in the Sunset District. I decided at the age of twelve that I wanted to be a lawyer after seeing my father's love of the law and his ability to do justice and achieve social change through his profession. We shared the practice, cases, trials, ideas, and our work lives for over thirty years.</p><p>I am a strong advocate for women's healthcare issues.</p><p>I have been interested in women's healthcare issues since I began to practice. At that time - and unfortunately even now - the healthcare system and the drug and medical device companies treated women differently than men. This led me to develop expertise in the areas of medical malpractice involving women, such as obstetrical malpractice, and in the area of drugs and medical devices designed especially for women such as IUDs, DES (the drug given to pregnant women to prevent miscarriage), breast implants, diet drugs, and other such products.</p><p>My experiences as one of the first women trial lawyers have made me a tougher, better lawyer with more empathy toward those who have suffered any kind of prejudice.</p><p>My law school class had a total of 220 students but only 20 women, the largest class of women it had ever had. At the time I attended law school and started to practice, there were many law professors, judges, and lawyers who did not think that women could, or should, practice law.</p><p>There were professors who told me that I was unfairly depriving some worthy young man of a place in the school and that I would practice for a year, get married, have children and quit. They were wrong about the quitting part.</p><p>There were judges who asked me to get coffee for them and the other trial lawyers during trial. There was the judge who told me women should try only divorce cases just as I was about to begin a medical malpractice trial. There were male lawyers who came unglued when confronted by vigorous advocacy by a woman lawyer. And so on. Fortunately, these experiences have dissipated with time, personal success and recognition and with the entry of many more women into the profession.</p><p>Women make very effective trial lawyers, bringing many special qualities that make them great advocates for individual plaintiffs. One of my highest verdicts came when I gave my closing argument nine months pregnant and that baby, my daughter, Kate, now practices with us at Hersh & Hersh.</p><p>I am happy and proud to be a woman and a trial lawyer. Most of all, I love the practice of law, I love a good trial, and I believe in our system of justice.</p><p class="b">Interests Outside of Law</p><p>I am married with four adult daughters, who live in the Bay Area. Two are lawyers, one is a Veterinarian, and the other is an entrepreneur, starting her own social/digital marketing business. Two of my daughters are married so I acquired two lovely sons. I love spending time with my family, including during our regular Sunday night dinners. I have always had poodles. My two Poodles, Elton and Olive, come to the office with me. I am also a Reining Horse Rider, which is a fancy phrase for a cowgirl, showing horses around the Bay Area when I can.</p><p class="b">Education</p><div class="bb">J.D., University of California at Berkeley, Boalt Hall School of Law, Berkeley, California, 1970</div><div>Honors: Member and Editor, Law Review Journal</div><br><div class="bb">B.A., University of California, Berkeley, 1967</div><div>Honors: Graduated Phi Beta Kappa Major: Anthropology</div><br><p class="b">Jurisdictions Admitted to Practice</p><div>California, 1971</div><div>U.S. District Court Northern District of California</div><br><p class="b">Professional & Bar Association Memberships</p><div>San Francisco Trial Lawyers Association</div><div>Member Since: 1971</div><div>President: 1979 (First Woman President)</div><div>American Board of Trial Advocates: Select organization admitting only those with significant trial experience and high ethics.</div><div>Consumer Attorneys of California</div><p class="b">Classes/Seminars Taught</p><div>Law Professor, Teaching, Personal Injury Litigation, Hastings College of the Law</div><div>Many CLE Courses on depositions, trial and discovery generally.</div><p class="b">Honors and Awards</p><ul><li>Lawdragon 500 Guide of Leading Plaintiffs' Lawyers, 2007 - Present</li><li>California Lawyer Attorneys of the Year Award, 2006 - Present</li><li>One of Northern California's Super Lawyers, Law & Politics Magazine, 2005 - Present</li><li>One of Northern California's Super Lawyers, Law & Politics Magazine, 2006 - Present</li><li>One of Northern California's Super Lawyers, Law & Politics Magazine, 2007 - Present</li><li>One of Northern California's Super Lawyers, Law & Politics Magazine, 2008 - Present</li><li>One of the Top Fifty Women Litigators in California, Daily Journal</li><li>One of Northern California's Super Lawyers, Law & Politics Magazine, 2009 - Present</li><li>Lifetime Achievement Award, San Francisco Trial Lawyers Association 2010</li><li>Super Lawyer, Super Lawyers Magazine, 2016</li></ul></div></div><div class="dotborders right"><div class="dots shorter"></div><div class="break"></div><div class="clear"></div><div class="dots short"></div><div class="clear"></div><div class="dots short"></div></div><div class="attorney" id="mark"><div class="picture mark left"></div><div class="name">Mark E.

I have worked on a variety of personal injury matters: medical malpractice involving death and injury, including birth injury, stroke, failed surgery, dangerous and defective drug and device, automobile, pedestrian, bicycle accidents, and business litigation. I have handled all parts of a case from before it is filed through trial.</p><p>I am passionate about fighting for justice, winning and achieving great results for my clients. I had the honor of growing up watching my family, full of incredible lawyers, work passionately to achieve justice and social change by advocating for and helping people who had been injured. I was inspired to do the same. I have the additional privilege of working with my mother, Nancy, learning from her incredible experience and sharing her unwavering passion for justice, the law and our work.</p><p>Besides successfully representing people through trial and settlements, one of the things I have valued most is being able to use skill, intellect and perseverance to change the law. I was part of a team that won an appeal in the First District Court of Appeal. The case involved permanent injuries, including blindness and burn-like rashes, sustained by a woman from taking a dangerous drug that came without warnings about its risks. The team of Hersh &amp; Hersh lawyers on the case uncovered that the warnings were intentionally omitted from the patient handout pursuant to an agreement between two entities. Hersh &amp; Hersh sued the software provider that distributed the information and altered the software to exclude the warnings. The software vendor filed an anti-SLAPP Motion claiming it owed no duty to our injured client. I prevailed in briefing and argument at the trial court level when the Defendant’s anti-SLAPP motion was denied. The Defendant appealed the denial, and I, along with a team of attorneys, won on appeal, resulting in a published opinion, Hardin v. PDX, Inc. (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 159, that changed the face of the law.</p><p>Outside of the law, I’ve coached a high school mock trial team and was thrilled when our team made it to the California State Finals in 2016 and again in 2017. I live in Marin County with my husband and young daughter. My husband and I are lucky to have our family in the area and love spending time with our family and close friends. I also enjoy traveling and skiing. I am an avid runner, running 13 half marathons in 2013 and am grateful to live in the beautiful Bay Area.</p><p class="b">Education</p><div class="bb">J.D., University of San Francisco School of Law, San Francisco, California, 2011.</div><br><div class="bb">B.A., Barnard College, Columbia University, New York, New York, 2006.</div><div>Honors: Magna Cum Laude</div><div>Major: American Studies, focus and Senior Thesis in Women&#39;s History and Health Issues</div><br><p class="b">Jurisdictions Admitted to Practice</p><div>California, 2011</div><div>U.S. District Court Northern District of California</div><br><div class="b">Professional &amp; Bar Association Memberships:</div><ul><li>Bar Association of San Francisco</li><li>San Francisco Trial Lawyers Association (SFTLA)</li><li>Consumer Advocates of California (CAOC)</li></ul><div class="b">Honors and Awards</div><ul><li><a href="/pdf/2016_08_02_14_54_12.pdf" target="_new">Rising Star by Super Lawyers Magazine, 2016</a></li><li>Rising Star by Super Lawyers Magazine, 2017</li></ul></div></div><div class="dotborders left"><div class="dots shorter"></div><div class="break"></div><div class="clear"></div><div class="dots short"></div><div class="clear"></div><div class="dots short"></div></div><div class="attorney" id="brendan"><div class="picture brendan right"></div><div class="name">Brendan Gannon</div><div class="title">Associate</div><div class="copy"><p>I became an Associate at Hersh & Hersh in 2016.
