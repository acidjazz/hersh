They often fail to do what they can to protect themselves by  asking those questions and not being afraid to do so or by going on the internet to research a drug prescribed or a surgical procedure recommended.",'I always encourage people to ask questions, do research and even call me for advice BEFORE undergoing a surgical procedure or taking a particular drug. In my work as <a href="http://www.hershlaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1417895.html">San Francisco injury lawyer</a>, I have represented many patients who ultimately became harmed by drugs and procedures they did not know would hurt them. Sometimes they were never informed of the risks involved in taking the medication or having a particular surgical procedure or medical device implant.','Health care providers are required by law to obtain an informed consent whenever they recommend treatment.  In California, our supreme court has established that a physician is required to disclose <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/california/cal3d/8/229.html">&#8220;all information relevant to a meaningful decisional process.&#8221; <em>Cobbs v. Grant</em></a> (1972) 8 Cal.3d 229, 242. That means doctors and other medical practitioners must tell patients what alternatives exist to recommended treatment, what risks are presented by the recommended treatment, and what to expect if they follow the medical advice being given them.',"In our law practice, we have represented many clients who have suffered serious injury as a result of having been inadequately informed. At trial involving patient injuries, often the jury instructions we propose which are well-established in California have to do with informed consent, the failure to provide informed consent and related issues that a jury must decide.","When a doctor prescribes a drug, the patient needs to ask the following questions:","<blockquote>First, why are you prescribing this drug and are there other drugs that perform the same or similar functions?  Second, is this a new drug on the market? (Doctors are very susceptible to persuasion by drug reps that they should try new drugs which do not have a track record and can be dangerous); Third, what are the side effects of the drug; are there any side effects that can cause death or serious injury?; Fourth, what should I look for when taking the drug to determine whether or not I am  suffering ill effects from the drug; what should I do if any changes occur after I begin to take the drug?  </blockquote>",'After these questions are answered, the patient should go on line and research the drug for side effects. The <a href="http://www.fda.gov">Food and Drug Administration</a> has a website where one can access adverse event reports pertaining to drugs and medical devices which are on the market. That is also a good resource for information. Taking these steps might well avoid the types of serious injuries that our clients have suffered from drugs prescribed by their physicians.',"If you have concerns after asking these questions and researching the drug itself, call your doctor and discuss these with him or her. Do not feel that you are being a &#8220;difficult&#8221; patient or are outside your rights to be very comfortable about your own health. Do not let your physician or medical staff cause you to believe that you do not have a right to know these things. You do. If you believe that your doctor is not willing to fully discuss and address your concerns, consider finding a physician that is more open and willing to go through this process with you.","The same issues and concerns for patients apply to recommended surgical procedures.

Regardless of the size of your employer&#8217;s business, you might be entitled to recover minimum wage, overtime, meal and rest breaks, prompt payment of wages, detailed wage statements and reimbursement.',"Often employees discover that they have been misclassified in their employment as &#8220;independent contractors&#8221; or as employees &#8220;exempt&#8221; from wage and hour protections. This is practice that employers use to avoid payment of wages and benefits to which employees are entitled.","Recent successes should give employees some hope that they can recover what the law allows in their employment.  For example, our law firm helped secure a $1.5 million settlement in two related cases where a company refused to pay termite inspectors overtime or provide meal and rest breaks.","Under California law, wage and hour obligations vary depending on the status of the employee. That is why some employers seek to avoid their wage and hour obligation by claiming that an employee is an independent contractor, exempt outside salesperson, administrative assistant, professional or executive.","But there are very specific requirements that have to be met in order for an employer to classify an employee as an independent contractor or exempt employee. Sometimes, employers misclassify their employees in violation of the law, in the hope that they will not contest the classification. But getting help from experts can lead to recovery of wages that should have been paid.","Another area in which employers might not comply with the law is in the guaranteed minimum wage which is mandated both by the federal, state and sometimes the local law. This area of compliance can be difficult for the employee to uncover when an hourly wage is not obvious. However, experts can help employees determine their actual minimum wage and seek recovery from employers who are not paying what is due.","Another very important area of compliance is the protection that employees work only mandated hours. When certain employees are asked to work more than 8 hours per day or 40 hours per week, they might well be entitled to premium overtime pay.

If you click on the link above, you will be taken to the California Department of Insurance website and you will find answers to basic questions about auto insurance, including uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.',"When you are involved in an accident, the driver responsible for resulting injuries may only have the minimum amount of insurance coverage required under the law and this may not be enough to cover injuries and damages. You need to make sure you have enough uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage through your own vehicle policy to cover your needs. Getting the highest amount of uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage is fast, inexpensive, easy and worthwhile.","To secure this type of coverage, contact your automobile insurance carrier and get the maximum amount available. Make sure that you&#8217;re insured because others may not be. We know this is important as we have represented a number of individuals in motor vehicle accidents and have recovered damages for their injuries, including using uninsured or underinsured motorist policies.","Another cautionary note for our readers is knowing when your case begins. Did you know if you are injured in a motor vehicle accident or otherwise, your case starts when the other person&#8217;s or company&#8217;s insurance representative contacts you for a statement or for medical information?  We recommend that you do not give a statement and do not &#8220;give away&#8221; your medical information or current medical status.","Instead, retain a lawyer and have that lawyer advise you immediately.  It might seem like the insurance representative is trying to help you resolve your case quickly and easily.

Serious injury caused by the negligence of another person or a defective product, can leave a victim in pain. It can also lead to a sense of vulnerability and fear. Lawyers have the opportunity to represent our clients to make sure they are compensated for losses caused by others. As lawyers, we cannot change the fact that our clients have suffered injury. But we can help to provide them with the financial and other assistance to which they are entitled under the law. We are able to <a href="https://www.justia.com/trials-litigation/docs/caci/3900/3902.html">seek both economic and non-economic damages</a> to help injured victims deal with their lives after a tragic accident or injury.',"For example, during labor and delivery if a preventable injury occurs, we look to the relevant evidence to prove negligence by reviewing the prenatal chart, the labor and delivery record, the fetal monitor tracings, the neonatal intensive care records and more. Parents need legal support after a labor and delivery that results in injury to their infant. As a mother myself, I find great personal satisfaction in representing families of an injured child. Helping young victims and their families will not take away the damage that has been done, but we can connect families with medical experts that provide guidance and support and we can secure the support families will need to care for their injured baby as he or she grows.",'Another area of legal expertise includes cases that are the result of the negligence of <a href="http://www.reproductivefacts.org">fertility clinics </a>or sperm banks and related entities. Families put their future in the hands of fertility clinics to help them become parents. There is nothing more emotionally charged than going through this often very intense process. But in our law practice we have encountered fertility clinics that fail to provide proper protocols and procedures, or oversight and adherence to regulations. Fertility clinic mistakes happen because there is no oversight or regulation, because the clinics think they are dealing with desperate people, because the clinics are more interested in profit than proficiency. Mistakes happen in the lab with the embryologists, in the failure to check and verify the specimens. Mistakes happen because sperm banks do not use simple procedures to check the donors against their completed forms which are designed to generate income for the donor and the bank. Mistakes happen which are egregious and devastating. Our representation in this field of law is not only gratifying, but it is also the only way those who have been damaged by these mistakes can find a way to heal from them.','Another important are of law practice in our field of law is when a product causes an injury. Federal agencies such as the <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov">Consumer Products Safety Commission</a> institutes recalls when a product has caused, or is likely to cause, injury or death. But what happens to those who have already been injured or lost their lives due to a defective product? Lawyers research the product and determine how or why the product failed. Did it have a defect in design? Did the manufacturer know the problem and hide it? Often we represent individuals or groups of individuals who have been harmed by products that the manufacturer knew were problematic and could cause injury, but withheld that information in order to profit from the sale of these products. sell products. A recent example of this is the widespread problems with airbags. We expect car manufacturers to provide safe products, especially those that are intended to keep us safe rather than harm us.',"Our firm has forced defective products off the market and we view our clients as our partners in helping to right these wrongs.
